## About Us
Google Developer Groups on Campus CAU is a university-based community where students passionate about technology come together to learn, build, and grow as developers.

We create an environment where students can explore Google's cutting-edge technologies through hands-on projects and collaborative learning. Our community focuses on practical development experience - from building real-world applications to contributing to open source projects.

Through regular workshops, study sessions, and hackathons, we help students bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and industry practices. Whether you're just starting your development journey or looking to deepen your expertise, GDGoC CAU provides the resources, mentorship, and community support to help you succeed.

We believe in learning by doing, sharing knowledge freely, and building connections that last beyond graduation. Join us to work on meaningful projects, connect with like-minded developers, and grow your skills in a supportive community environment.
